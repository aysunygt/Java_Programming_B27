If Statements
-----------------------------
IF STATEMENTS:
    Control the flow of our program

    Single IF

        if(boolean_expression){
        }

    When the boolean is true: the if block will run
    when the boolean is false: nothing, continue execution after if statement

    IF ELSE

        if(boolean_expression){
        // statements for TRUE condition
        } else {
        // statements for FALSE condition
        }

    when the boolean is true: the if block will run
    when the boolean is false: the else block will run
-------------------
DEBUGGING:
    - to find issues in the code, by checking one line at a time, or just to check what each line of code does

    -In Intellij we will be able to execute one line at a time

    STEPS:
        1) create a breakpoint by clicking on the left bar, on the line you want to start with
        2) click on the green run button in the file, and select the debug option
        3) So, program is running, to execute line by line click the step over button. /\

    While debugging you have the debug window, which will show extra information about your program, but there is also a console tab to show the output of your program
