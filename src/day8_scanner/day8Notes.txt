Day 8 -- Scanner
-----------------------------
Hard coding : information/value is directly in the code
Dynamic: it changes when needed, comes from outside the code

Scanner : has methods that allow us to type in the console. The information typed can be used in the code
        Method : some code that someone wrote, so we can use..

                nextByte()
                nextShort()
                nextInt()  **
                nextLong()
                nextFloat()
                nextDouble()  **
                nextBoolean()

                next() : get a String from the console, but only one word
                nextLine() : get a String from the console, but can be multiple words. Accepts the enter input

                Problem: using nextLine() after any other Scanner method causes the enter input to not store out data properly, so we need to add an extra nextLine() between the two parts.

               ->>  if you only have nextLine() methods there is no problem.

Using Scanner:
    - import : to use a file outside of the package we have to import the class

    - create Scanner object:
        Scanner name = new Scanner(System.in);

    - use the Scanner methods
        object.method()
