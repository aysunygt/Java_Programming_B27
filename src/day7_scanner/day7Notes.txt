Short Circuit:
    2 operators. More efficient in execution. When the code runs left to right, if the result of the boolean is known it doesn't need to continue executing

            && || vs & \

            - double && ||
                program will not keep running when the result is known

            - single & |
                program will run all  the code left to right always, no matter if the result of the boolean is already determined

** SCANNER **
    -   Scanner is a CLASS that has METHODS that allows us to type values in the console
    - Class are java files
    - Methods are blocks of code that are ready to use
    - Why are we using Scanner?
        * to avoid hard code. Get the idea of how to use information that comes form outside of the side

    - How do we use Scanner?
        1) import the class
            import: allows us to use a file that is in a different package
            - order of a java file;
                package -> imports -> class   = PIC

            Scanner is in   java.util

            Syntax:

                import packageName.className;
                import java.util.Scanner;

        2) create a Scanner object
            Scanner name = new Scanner(System.in);

            common names for the object: scan, scanner, input, keyboard, in

        3) use/ run methods from the object

            syntax to call method:
                object.method()

               nextByte()
               nextShort()
               nextInt()  **
               nextLong()
               nextFloat()
               nextDouble()  **
               nextBoolean()
               next()
               nextLine()  **
