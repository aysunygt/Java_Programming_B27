Multi Branch If Statements / Ternary
----------------------------------------

Multi Branch:
    Whenever there is multiple conditions that are related we can use the multi branch to handle them..

    Execution for multi branch : the first condition is checked, if it is true, the first block is executed, otherwise(false) it will check the next conditions..

    if(boolean 1) {
        // statements that get executed when boolean 1 is TRUE
    } else  if ( boolean 2 ) {
        //statements that get executed when boolean 2 is TRUE
    } else if ( boolean 3 ) {
        // statements that get executed when boolean 3 is TRUE
    }


    NOTE : you can declare as many ELSE IF blocks are needed
    NOTE: you can add ELSE at the end, it is optional
    NOTE: once a condition is true and its code block is executed the other conditions are NOT checked..
    NOTE: multi branch statements are used to make the code more efficient, more readable
    ---------------------------------------------

IF without BRACKETS

    if statements can be created without brackets, but we will not be able to write multiple statements

    If without brackets, will execute only the next line after if

    Take away: always use brackets

 ------------------------------------------------

 TERNARY

    - different way to write an if statement

    -   returnValue = boolean_expression ? trueValue : falseValue;

            ? -> if
            : -> else
