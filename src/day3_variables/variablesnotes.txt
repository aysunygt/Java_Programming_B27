-- Variables are containers for storing data/information values
-- Benefits are -> Improves the re-usability of the data multiple times
        helps to reduce hard coding
-- The value store din a variable can be changed during program execution
-- Variables must be declared before use
-- variables names should be readable
-- When variable names contain two or more words, use camelCase
-- There are 2 Java Data Types
    1. Primitive
          - integer(whole numbers) -> byte, short, int (default by compile) , long
          - float - point numbers -> double (default by compiler), float
          - Characters -> char
          - Boolean -> boolean

    2. Non- Primitive
          - String
          - Array
          - Classes
          - Etc

   Difference between types; how much memory is take for each variable

   whole numbers are int by default, so if we need a big number that in cannot hold, the program will not compile, so to fic this we will use L or l at the end of the number to tell the compiler the number is a long type, not an int type

   Float numbers are double by default, so if we ever want to make a float variable we will need to use F or f with the number to tell the compiler it is a float number, not a double number

   - Concatenation:
    we can use the + sign to combine variables with characters
        -> we have usef it for making messages
----------------------------------------
  SYNTAX:
        dataType variableName = value;

        int age = 26;
----------------------------------------
Rules for Variable Names;

    - the first character must be one of the letters a-z or A-Z, and underscore(_), or a dollar sign($)
    - after the first character, you may use letters a-z or A-Z, the digits, underscore(_), or dollar sign ($)
    - CANNOT include spaces

    Valid example:
        double myVar;
        int MyVar1;
        long $myvar;
        char _myVar;
        short my20thBirthday$;

    Invalid Example:
        byte 1myVar;
        short *myVar1;
        int ageOfThe@Employer100;
        long my20th Birthday$;
