public static void main(String[] args) -> main method
        -> main method is how we can run java codes, for now this is what we always need to run anything

System.out.println(); -> this is how we print on to the console

Intellij components;
    src; source folder
    package; folder
    class; java file
    console; window at the bottom of our program. It displays the output of a program.

In java ;
    java does not care about space sensitivity
    java cares about case sensitivity

    to print characters use double quotations

SHORTCUTS:
        Mac/Windows

    copy : command / control + c
    paste : command / control + v
    cut : command / control + x
    undo : command / control + z
    select everything : command / control + a

        To take a ScreenShot:

            mac: command + shift + 5
            windows: control + shift + s

Intellij Shortcuts:
    main , psvm -> main method
    sout -> system.out.println();
    soutv -> prints aa value that you want to print

    comment -> highlight what lines you want to do comment , then command / control + /

In intellij, we make comments sometimes to explain what the codes are for or what they mean and they don't get executed
There are 3 types ;
    - // this one is for single line comment
    - /*
        this one is for multiple line comments
        */
    - /**
        *
        *
        *
        */   -> this one is for java doc comment -- similar to multi line, it just provides additional funtions,
                helps to generate HTML documentation


    TODO: add in a comment to mark something as a todo item.
    // todo: you can open it on bottom left todo menu or/ view -> tool windows -> todo


   print vs println
    print(); print on the same line on the console, does NOT break the line
    println(); print whatever you give on the current line, the it will go to the next line

ESCAPE SEQUENCES;

    - if you want to print certain characters that exist in java syntax we need to use the escape sequences syntax
      & we will use \ this sign first then the character

        code     |  output
        \"  "\      ""
        \\ \\       \
        \' '\       ''
        \t          tab   -> space
        \n          next line

Naming Conventions
    - Package : lowercase, no space, can use underscores
            Ex: today_is_monday

    - Classes (java files): First letter is uppercase, then the rest are camel case (PascalCase)
            PascalCase : when you want to represent multiple words together all of the each letter start with uppercase
                Ex: TodayIsMonday

    -Variables: camelCase. The first word start with lowerCase, then every other word after should start with an uppercase letter
                Ex: todayIsMonday
